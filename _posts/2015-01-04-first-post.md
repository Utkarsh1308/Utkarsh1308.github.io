![Acceptance Letter](https://i.imgur.com/UMx8cuT.png)

This has been my life goal since my 1st year in College. I have seen many friends apply for this internship and I have seen both failures and successes. So I decided I would have a crack at this prestigious internship too!

I started contributing to coala since August last year. Out of all the open source organizations I know, coala was the most newcomer friendly to come across. It rekindled my passion in open source after I got demotivated trying to understand how some other organizations worked. I was very happy when my first patch got accepted! Over time I fixed more issues of higher difficulties and decided I would be applying to coala for GSOC 2019. 

It took me a long time trying to draft my proposal and finally sent it knowing my slim chances of getting selected.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that I got selected! This was my life's biggest achievement! 

So I would be working in coala on the project of **Improving Diff Handling**. I hope to have an awesome summer exploring unchartered territories and doing awesome work under guidance by my mentor John.
