![Acceptance Letter](https://i.imgur.com/UMx8cuT.png)

This has been my life goal since my 1st year in College. I have seen many friends apply for this internship and I have seen both failures and successes. So I decided I would have a crack at this prestigious internship too!

I didn't know how to write a line of code till I came to college. Here programming was all the craze. I quickly jumped into the bandwagon and python caught my interest. It was easy to learn but difficult to master. Even now after 2 years I still learn new things every now and then.

During this time I also came to know about open source and GSoC. I didn't know how to start contributing at first. The whole process looked overwhelming to me. So I decided I would go to the GSoC homepage and have a look at the organizations from last year. I went to the github pages of the ones which looked interesting to me and thus I began my journey in open source. 

Out of all the open source organizations I searched, coala was the most newcomer friendly to come across. It rekindled my passion in open source after I got demotivated trying to understand how some other organizations worked. The mentors were helpful and they had an easy to understand system on place regarding contributing and labels for issues that were easy to solve for newcomers at first.

I was very happy when my first patch got accepted! Over time I fixed more issues of higher difficulties and eventually I decided I would want to work with coala for GSoC. 

It took me a long time trying to find the right project for me and making a proposal. I submitted it with my fingers crossed knowing fully well my slim chances of getting selected.

Following this my final exams started and I had to shift my focus to them. The date for the results was coming closer each day. 

On the night the results were announced I looked through the accepted proposals. I scrolled down slowly and found my name in the list.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that I got selected! This was my life's biggest achievement! 

So I would be working in coala on the project - **Improving Diff Handling**. I hope to have an awesome summer exploring uncharted territories and doing awesome work under guidance by my mentor John.
