Where do I even start!? So the excitement of getting selected wasn't enough as it is! First of all I got my selection news in the middle 
of my exams, so I had to contain my excitement while trying to somehow focus on finishing them . My exams ended on 13th and I had a chat with my mentor the next day. We discussed the current project and decided it was better for me if I changed my project to incorporate support for **XML Diffs** along with the existing unified diff handling system in place. This project was more suited for my field of study in college. Also the original project was hard, and we wanted to ensure I had something I would be able to complete in my internship period.

So I had 12 days to come up with a whole new project plan for the new project we decided. This involved coming up with designs and milestones for Phase 1 to Phase 3. I researched around and learnt a lot of new things along the way. Before I got this project I thought binary diffs weren't even possble but now I had to come up with a way to incorporate them in coala. These days were full of learning and 
hard work for me and I enjoyed the challenge. 

But I still felt left behind seeing that many of the other GSOC students had already submitted their coala enhancement proposals and I was still trying to come up with a proper project plan. I had to achieve a lot of things in these limited number of days. But I guess that was expected of me now that I am working for an internship at this level.

These days were grueling for me! There were some hard times with the deadline for Community Bonding Period coming up closer and closer. But I decided I would work all the way and try my hardest to complete the work expected of me. My mentor helped me throught this period clearing all my queries and providing help when I was stuck. If anyone is reading this, never lose hope in such situations. Such tense situations would prove fruitful for you in the future to handle time and work more efficiently. 

Finally I was able to draft my project plan in the nick of time. Thus one phase of my GSOC Journey comes to an end and another part begins.
Phase 1 is going to start soon! The hardest part is still ahead of me. Let's hope I am ready for it!!!
