After submitting a PR for adding context to the diffs shown by coala. I thought of some ways to further improve the context by showing the parents (class/function) for the affected line of code. 

To achieve this we create a data structure containing the names of the parentkeywords for the languages which coala belongs to. Then we modify the **get_context** and **print_before_context** method in **ConsoleInteraction.py**

On running coala on a [sample file](https://github.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/blob/master/context/main.c) with **SpaceConsistencyBear** the diffs look like below:

![context_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/master/photos/context_1.png)
![context_2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/master/photos/context_2.png)
![context_3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/master/photos/context_3.png)
![context_4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/master/photos/context_4.png)
![context_5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/master/photos/context_5.png)
![context_6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/master/photos/context_6.png)
![context_7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Utkarsh1308/gsoc-materials/master/photos/context_7.png)

Also **detect_encoding** method from **coala_utils** doesn't give the correct encoding when run with UTF-32 files due to the similarity
in Byte Order Markers for UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings. Since we are using startswith() to detect the file encodings the method mistakes 
the UTF-32 encoded files as UTF-16 hence the tests I had written for UTF-32 files were failing. This can be fixed by changing the 
**detect_encoding** function to equate the BOMs instead of using startswith().

## Binary Bear

The difficulty in creating a binary bear from creating bears for other languages is that all the Diff class methods do string operations
to create the Diffs. We can't use **modified()** or the addition/deletion methods for creating our binary diffs. So we need some new 
methods for handling binary code. 

The first task before adding support for binary diffs was to look for a particular binary format which can be fixed and creating a bear 
for the same which will generate binary diffs showing the changes in bytes. 

I had worked on the multidiff library the past month so given two binary files I could create a binary diff. 

**ImageCompressionBear** is a binary bear which uses optimage, jpegoptim, jpegtran, pngcrush, optipng to see if the image can be 
compressed and stores the number of bytes reduced if it's compressed.

The code for the bear is given below:

With the bear decided I will now move on to adding code in coala for creating binary diffs which I will cover in my next blog. 
Once we have implemented Binary Diffs we will implement XML Diffs using the same approach which would be fairly easier.
